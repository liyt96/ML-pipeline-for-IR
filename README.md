# ML-pipeline-for-IR

### Introduction

A Machine Learning pipeline for Information Retrieval.

The Machine Learning model takes 5 IR scores: Okapi TF, TF IDF, BM 25, Unigram LM with Laplace smoothing and Unigram LM Unigram LM with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing as features.

The model fits on a [Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) algorithm.
